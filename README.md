# **David Culp | Principal Solutions Architect**

**35 Years of Infrastructure, Security, and Deterministic AI Proof-of-Work**

This repository serves as a technical "paper trail" for my career. I prioritize demonstrable architecture, data sovereignty, and open-source innovation over standardized vendor certifications.

### **📂 The Technical Exhibits**

1. **Enterprise SD-WAN (32 Sites)**: Orchestrated a Zero-Trust healthcare network expansion using Fortinet and FirstNet 5G; achieved 100% uptime through sub-second automated failover logic.  
2. **Autonomous Datacenter**: A 6-layer Zero-Trust security stack featuring Ansible orchestration, ELK SIEM monitoring, and FreeIPA centralized identity.  
3. **Proxmox HA Cluster**: Engineered a 3-node hyperconverged cluster with ZFS replication and hardware fencing, verified for \<120s automated failover of mission-critical workloads.  
4. **OpenCompliance-AI**: A local-first GRC engine built with Python (FastAPI) and Mistral-Nemo to automate NIST 800-53 assessments without cloud dependency.  
5. **OpenClinical-AI**: A deterministic SQL-Augmented Generation platform for clinical C-CDA analysis, eliminating LLM hallucinations in high-stakes medical informatics.  
6. **The $1 Professional Conference Suite**: Resourceful engineering utilizing E-waste (S21FE hardware) as NDI endpoints on isolated VLANs, managed via Hexnode MDM.  
7. **OpenOperations-AI**: A "Sovereign Watcher" for operational reporting. Uses OCR and local AI to audit vendor risk and score expenses against NIST security standards.
