# David Culp: Principal Solutions Architect Portfolio
> **35 Years of Infrastructure, Security, and Clinical AI Proof-of-Work**

This repository serves as a technical "paper trail" for my 35-year career. I prioritize demonstrable architecture and open-source innovation over standardized vendor certifications.

### 🚀 Flagship Projects
* **[OpenClinical-AI](link)**: Local-first, privacy-focused RAG for healthcare.
* **[OpenCompliance-AI](link)**: Automated NIST 800-53 GRC Assessment Engine.

### 📂 Technical Exhibits
1. **Enterprise SD-WAN (32 Sites)**: High-availability engineering with 5G failover.
2. **Autonomous Datacenter**: 6-layer Zero-Trust stack with Ansible orchestration.
3. **Proxmox HA Cluster**: ZFS replication and hardware fencing logic.
4. **OpenCompliance-AI**: NIST 800-53 GRC engine built with FastAPI and local LLMs to replace expensive proprietary cloud auditors.
5. **OpenClinical-AI**: Deterministic SQL-Augmented Generation for offline C-CDA XML analysis. High-stakes clinical informatics with zero PHI leakage.
6. **The $1 Profwssional Conference Suite**: Resourceful engineering using E-waste S21FE hardware as NDI endpoints on isolated VLANs. MDM-managed resilience.
